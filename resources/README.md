h1. tictactoe, yo.

h2. Who are you, and who am I?
You're someone who belongs to the freeCodeCamp community. Or you're an employer wanting to see samples of my work.

I'm Lino. I've worked in software product management for 3 years. And I build stuff, too.

h2. But why go through the trouble?
I want to prove that I can work with software to build solutions to problems. As a product manager, I know how to find problems and proposed solutions to customer pain points. And now I want to help build those solutions.

This project adds to the portfolio of my work, which demonstrates what I can do.

h2. What am I looking at?
You're looking at tic tac toe, as part of the curriculum found at freecodecamp.https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game

h2. How did I build this? Where did you get the requirements?
Requirements came from the curriculum. The user stories read as follows:
* I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
* My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
* I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

h2. What technologies did you leverage to make this game?
* html
* css
* vanilla js

I also built this with the principle of mobile first.

h2. What other sources of inspiration did you use to make this game?
I wanted to make something simple. In its original form, tictactoe consists of lines on paper. I choose a black and white pallet for that reason.

h2. I want to shower you with money and praise - how can I get in touch with you?
